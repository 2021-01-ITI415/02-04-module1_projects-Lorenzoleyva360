Prototype 1

My prototype 1 game is called Diamond Mine. The main goal of this game is to try to collect all the diamonds without touching any Stone Blocks. If you touch one of the Stone blocks by accident, you will be respawn back to where you started, which it’ll take more time for you to collect the other diamonds around. I was going to add the timer for 1 minute and 30 second but I wasn’t sure exactly how to do it. In addition to that, for this assignment I decided to implement the idea of the roll a ball assignment and making it more challenging.
